            Hello there! I'm Luke
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify text-slate-200">
            Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a passionate software engineer who
            has been immersed in the world of technology since 2018, when I was
            just 20 years old.I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Information
            Systems from Unifoa, and for the past two years,I have been working
            as a full-stack developer at CityConnect. Challenges fuel my drive,
            and I thrive in problem-solving scenarios.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether it's tackling complex coding issues or finding innovative
            solutions, I'm always up for the challenge. When I'm not engrossed
            in coding, you'll likely find me enjoying a cup of coffee, playing
            League of Legends or Squad, or spending quality time with my beloved
            cat named Kiki. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals,
            collaborate on new projects, and continue my journey as a software
            engineerðŸ˜Š
